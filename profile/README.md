# Greyborne

**Greyborne** is a long-term builder’s studio creating ventures across real estate, health, media, and alternative assets.  
We design AI-native companies from the ground up—modular, API-first, and agent-compatible.  

Our approach blends **infrastructure + intelligence + community**, focused on solving problems in markets where trust, compliance, and workflows matter most.
